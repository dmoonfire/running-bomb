What? You actually want to figure out how to play
this game? Well, I guess that makes sense. Since
you already got this far, you can probably figure
out the menu: up, down, and enter (or space or
right) to select a menu.

=2 Playing the Game

You have a ship. It moves around, just like you
want it to. Use the number pad on the right to
control your ship.

  8 - Up
  6 - Right
  2 - Down
  4 - Left
  0 - Brakes - Slows you down

  [ - Zoom in
  ] - Zoom out

  Escape - Quit

Actually <Escape> will get you out of most screens
in the game and to quit in a hurry, just hit
<Escape> a few times in rapid succession.
